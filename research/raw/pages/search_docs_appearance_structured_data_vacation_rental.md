# Vacation rental (VacationRental) structured data

 

 When you add structured data to your vacation rental listing pages, Google Search can show
 your listing in richer ways. Users can see listing information, such as the name, description,
 images, location, rating, reviews and more right in search results.

## 
 Before You Begin

 These instructions are intended for sites that have already connected with a Google Technical
 Account Manager and have access to the Hotel Center.
 If you're interested in integrating your vacation rental listings, you can fill out the
 vacation rental interest form.
 Filling out the form is an expression of interest and doesn't guarantee an invitation into the
 Early Adopters Program.

This feature is limited to sites that meet certain eligibility criteria and additional
steps are required
to complete the integration. To learn more about how to list your vacation rentals on Google,
visit the integration starter guide.

 

## 
 How to add structured data
 

 Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
 content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about
 how structured data works.
 

 
 Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data.

 
 
- Add the required properties. Based on the
 format you're using, learn where to insert structured data on the page.
 
 Using a CMS? It may be easier to use a plugin that's integrated into your CMS.
 
 Using JavaScript? Learn how to
 generate structured data with JavaScript.
 
 
- Follow the guidelines.
 
- Validate your code using the
 Rich Results Test
 and fix any critical errors. Consider also fixing any non-critical issues that may be flagged
 in the tool, as they can help improve the quality of your structured data (however, this isn't necessary to be eligible for rich results). 
 
- Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
 accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
 login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
 ask Google to recrawl your URLs.
 Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
 may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
 
 
- To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
 submit a sitemap. You can automate this with the
 Search Console Sitemap API.

## Monitor rich results with Search Console

 
 Search Console is a tool that helps you monitor how your pages perform in Google Search.
 You don't have to sign up for Search Console to be included in Google Search results,
 but it can help you understand and improve how Google sees your site. We
 recommend checking Search Console in the following cases:
 
 
- After deploying structured data for the first time
 
- After releasing new templates or updating your code
 
- Analyzing traffic periodically
 

 
 
 

 

### 
 After deploying structured data for the first time
 

 
 After Google has indexed your pages, look for issues using the relevant
 Rich result status report.
 Ideally, there will be an increase of valid items, and no increase in invalid items. If you find issues
 in your structured data:

 
 
- Fix the invalid items.
 
- Inspect a live URL to check if the issue persists.
 
- Request validation using the status report.
 

 

### 
 After releasing new templates or updating your code
 

 When you make significant changes to your website, monitor for increases in structured data invalid items.
 
 
- If you see an increase in invalid items, perhaps you rolled out a new template that doesn't work, or your site interacts with the existing
 template in a new and bad way.
 
- If you see a decrease in valid items (not matched by an increase in invalid items), perhaps you are
 no longer embedding structured data in your pages. Use the 
 URL Inspection tool to learn what is causing the issue.
 

 

### 
 Analyzing traffic periodically
 

 Analyze your Google Search traffic using the Performance Report.
 The data will show you how often your page appears as a rich result in Search, how often users click on it and what is
 the average position you appear on search results. You can also automatically pull these
 results with the Search Console API.

 

## Troubleshooting

 
 If you're having trouble implementing or debugging structured data, here are some resources that
 may help you.
 

 
 
- If you're using a content management system (CMS) or someone else is taking care of your site,
 ask them to help you. Make sure to forward any Search Console message that details the issue to them.
 
- Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will show up in search results.
 For a list of common reasons why Google may not show your content in a rich result, see the
 General Structured Data Guidelines.
 
- You might have an error in your structured data. Check the
 list of structured data errors
 and the Unparsable structured data report.
 
- If you received a structured data manual action against your page, the structured data on
 the page will be ignored (although the page can still appear in Google Search results). To fix
 structured data issues, use the Manual Actions report.
 
 
- Review the guidelines again to identify if your content isn't compliant
 with the guidelines. The problem can be caused by either spammy content or spammy markup usage.
 However, the issue may not be a syntax issue, and so the Rich Results Test won't be able to
 identify these issues.
