# List of Google's special-case crawlers

 

 The special-case crawlers are used by specific Google products where there's an agreement between
 the crawled site and the product about the crawl process. For example, AdsBot ignores
 the global robots.txt user agent (*) with the ad publisher's permission. The general
 technical properties
 of Google's crawlers also apply to the special-case crawlers.

 The
 special-case crawlers may ignore robots.txt rules and so they operate from a different IP range
 than the common crawlers. The IP ranges are published in the
 special-crawlers.json object. The
 special-case crawlers' reverse DNS mask matches
 rate-limited-proxy-***-***-***-***.google.com.

 The following list shows the special-case crawlers, their user agent strings as they appear in
 the HTTP requests, their user agent tokens for the User-agent: line in robots.txt,
 and the products that are affected by crawl preferences for the crawler. The list is not
 exhaustive, it only covers the requestors that are more likely to show up in log files and that
 we've received questions about.

 Caution: The user agent string can be spoofed.
 Learn how to verify if a requestor is from Google.

 header whenever a user clicked your page in Search under appropriate conditions.
