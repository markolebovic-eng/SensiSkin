# Enhance AMP content in Google Search

 
 
 You can enhance your AMP content in Google
 Search by creating a basic AMP page, adding structured data, monitoring your pages, and
 practicing with codelabs.
 

 

## Create a basic AMP page

 
 
- 
 Create your first AMP page.
 
 
- 
 Follow the Google Search guidelines for AMP pages.
 
 
- 
 Make your content
 discoverable by linking your pages.
 For crawling and indexing, Google Search requires that an AMP page links to a
 canonical page. The
 canonical page can be either a non-AMP version of the page or it can be the AMP page itself.
 
 
- 
 Ensure that users can experience the same content and complete the same actions on AMP pages as
 on the corresponding canonical pages, where possible.
 
 
- 
 Use the AMP Test Tool to ensure that your page
 meets the Google Search requirements for a valid AMP HTML document.
 
 
- 
 Use the same
 structured data markup across both the
 canonical and AMP pages.
 
 
- 
 Apply common content best practices:
 
 
- Make sure that your robots.txt file doesn't
 block your AMP page.
 Use robots meta tags,
 data-nosnippet, and X-Robots-Tag where appropriate.
 
 
- 
 Follow the guidelines for
 hreflang for language and regional URLs.
 For AMP specific examples, see
 Internationalization.
 
 

 
 

 

## Create an AMP page using a CMS

If you serve your web content through a Content Management System (CMS), you can
use an existing CMS plugin (such as for WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla) or implement
custom functionality in your CMS to generate AMP content. If you intend to
customize your CMS, follow these guidelines in addition to Create a basic AMP page:

 

- Consider how AMP HTML files will fit your site's URL path scheme. If you're generating an AMP
 page in addition to a canonical non-AMP page, we recommend choosing one of the following URL schemes:
 
 
- https://www.example.com/myarticle/amp
 
- https://www.example.com/myarticle.amp.html
 

 

- Develop a structured data markup template. Here are some guidelines:
 
 
- Construct the template based on the requirements for the type of content
you are publishing.
 
- Refer to AMP Project metadata examples for sample templates for recipes, articles, videos, and reviews.
 

 
 

## Optimize for rich results

You can use structured data to enhance the appearance of your page in search results. AMP pages with
 structured data can appear as a rich result,
 like the Top stories carousel or host carousel.

 
 
- Implement structured data.
 
- Verify that your structured data parses correctly by using the Rich Results Test.

- Verify your complete AMP setup by using the AMP Test Tool.
 

## Monitor and improve your pages

Periodically check all of your AMP pages by monitoring the following reports:

 

- AMP status report: Catch site
 templating and other site-wide implementation issues that can affect large numbers of your AMP
 pages.

- Rich result status reports:
 Identify problems with your structured data and opportunities to provide additional structured
 data.
 

 If you need to stop serving your AMP pages from Google Search results, follow Remove AMP from Google Search results.

## Practice with codelabs

Here are some codelabs to practice building AMP pages:

 

- Learn how to build AMP pages with the AMP
foundations codelab.

- Add features like analytics, video embedding, social media integration, and
image carousels to your AMP pages with the Advanced concepts codelab.

- Build a beautiful, interactive, and canonical AMP pages codelab that incorporates many AMP
features and extended components.

- Use AMP components to build a PWA
experience with the AMP+PWA codelab.
 

## Resources

Now that you've created your AMP pages, here are some resources for learning more about other Google
 product integrations for AMP:

 

- Learn how to Create AMP ad
units.

- Learn how to monetize your AMP pages.

- Use Google Tag
Manager to optimize and measure marketing initiatives.

- Add analytics to your AMP pages to track user interactions with built-in Google Analytics
