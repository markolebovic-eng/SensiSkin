# Q&A (QAPage) structured data

 

Q&A pages are web pages that contain data in a question and answer format, which is one question
 followed by its answers. For content that represents a question and its
 answers, you can mark up your data with the 
 schema.org QAPage, Question, and Answer types.

Properly marked up pages are eligible to have a rich result displayed on the search results
 page. This rich treatment helps your site reach the right users on Search.
 For example, you might see a rich result for the user query "How do I remove a cable that is
 stuck in a USB port?" if the page has been marked up with answers to that question.

 In addition to enabling your content for the rich result treatment, marking up
 your Q&A page helps Google generate a better
 snippet for your page.
 The content from the answers may appear in the basic result if the rich
 result is not shown.

 

## 
 How to add structured data
 

 Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
 content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about
 how structured data works.
 

 
 Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data.

 
 
- Add the required properties. Based on the
 format you're using, learn where to insert structured data on the page.
 
 Using a CMS? It may be easier to use a plugin that's integrated into your CMS.
 
 Using JavaScript? Learn how to
 generate structured data with JavaScript.
 
 
- Follow the guidelines.
 
- Validate your code using the
 Rich Results Test
 and fix any critical errors. Consider also fixing any non-critical issues that may be flagged
 in the tool, as they can help improve the quality of your structured data (however, this isn't necessary to be eligible for rich results). 
 
- Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
 accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
 login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
 ask Google to recrawl your URLs.
 Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
 may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
 
 
- To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
 submit a sitemap. You can automate this with the
 Search Console Sitemap API.
