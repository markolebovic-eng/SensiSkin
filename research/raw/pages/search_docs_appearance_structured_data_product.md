# Introduction to Product structured data

 

 When you add structured data to your product pages, your product information can appear in richer
 ways in Google Search results (including
 Google Images and
 Google Lens). For example, users can see price,
 availability, review ratings, shipping information, and more right in search results.

## Deciding which markup to use

There are two main classes of product structured data. Follow the requirements for the type that best
 suits your use case:

 
- 
 Product snippets:
 For product pages where people can't directly purchase the product. This markup has more options
 for specifying review information, like
 pros and cons on an editorial product review page.
 
 
- 
 Merchant listings:
 For pages where customers can purchase products from you. This markup has more options for
 specifying detailed product information, like apparel sizing,
 shipping details,
 and return policy
 information.
 

 Note that there is some overlap between the two product features. In general, adding the required product information properties
 for merchant listings means that your product pages can also be eligible for product snippets.
 Both features have their own enhancements, so be sure to review both when deciding which markup
 makes sense in the context of your site (the more properties you can add, the more enhancements
 your page can be eligible for).

 Do you offer variants of your products? Adding product variant structured data
 can help Google better understand which products are variations of the same parent product. Both
 product snippets and merchant listings support product variants.

In addition to structured data for the individual products that you sell, we also recommend you add
 structured data defining the policies of your ecommerce business, nested under Organization markup:

 
- Merchant return policy:
 Specify the return policy (or policies) for your business.

- Loyalty Program:
 Specify the loyalty program that you offer.

## How shopping experiences can appear on Google Search

 Here's how shopping experiences can appear in Google Search results.
 This list is not exhaustive—Google Search is constantly exploring new and better ways
 to help people find what they're looking for, and the experiences may change over time.

 
 
 
 | 
 

##### Product snippet

 A text result
 that includes additional product information such as ratings, review information, price,
 and availability
 

 
 | 
 
 
 

 
 | 
 

##### Popular products

 
 Visually rich presentation of products for sale
 

 
 | 
 
 
 

 
 | 
 

##### Shopping knowledge panel

 
 Detailed product information with a list of sellers (using details such as
 product identifiers)
 

 
 | 
 
 
 

 
 | 
 

##### Google Images

 
 Annotated images of products available for sale
 

 
 | 
 
 
 

 
 

### Result enhancements

 Search result enhancements are shown at the discretion of each experience, and may
 change over time. For this reason, it is recommended to provide as much rich product information
 as available, without concern for the exact experiences that will use it.
 Here are some examples of how product rich results may be enhanced:

 
- Ratings: Enhance the appearance of your search result by providing customer reviews and ratings.
 
- Pros and Cons: Identify pros and cons
 in your product review description so they can be highlighted in search results.
 
- Shipping: Share shipping costs,
 especially free shipping, so shoppers understand the total cost.
 
- Availability: Provide availability
 data to help customers know when you have a product in stock.
 
- Price drop: Price drops are computed by Google by observing price
 changes for the product over time. Price drops are not guaranteed to be shown.
 
- Returns: Share return information,
 such as your return policy, fees involved in
 returns, and how many days customers have to return a product.

## Providing product data to Google Search

 To provide rich product data to Google Search you can add
 Product structured data to your web pages, upload data feeds with Google Merchant
 Center and opt into free listings within the Merchant Center console, or both. The Search Central
 documentation focuses on structured data on web pages.

 Providing both structured data on web pages and a Merchant Center feed maximizes
 your eligibility to experiences and helps Google correctly understand and verify your data.
 Some experiences combine data from structured data and Google Merchant Center feeds if
 both are available. For example, product snippets may use pricing data from your
 merchant feed if it's not present in the structured data on the page. The
 Google Merchant Center feed documentation
 includes additional recommendations and requirements for feed attributes.

 In addition to Google Search, learn more about eligibility to the
 Google Shopping tab
 by reading the
 data and eligibility requirements in Google Merchant Center.
