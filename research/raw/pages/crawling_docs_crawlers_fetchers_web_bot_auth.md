# Authenticate requests with Web Bot Auth (experimental)

 

 Google is testing usage of the Web Bot Auth
 IETF internet draft, which is a new cryptographic protocol that helps websites to validate that
 bots are authentic. We are testing the protocol with some AI agents hosted on Google
 infrastructure. This guide explains what Web Bot Auth is, the current status, and how you can
 implement verification in the experimental phase.

We don't sign every request of a particular agent. Be sure that you fall back
 to the established methods
 of bot verification.

## What is Web Bot Auth?

 Web Bot Auth is an experimental cryptographic protocol used to authenticate requests sent by bots.
 Instead of relying solely on self-reported headers and IP addresses, Web Bot Auth allows agents
 to cryptographically sign their requests.

 Using Web Bot Auth helps website owners identify automated traffic on their sites, and prevents
 other actors from attempting to spoof reputable agents. Web Bot Auth can bring the following benefits:

 
- Cryptographic certainty: Move beyond easily spoofed headers to a verified
 identity and decouple agent identity from IP addresses.
 
- Better observability: Gain clearer insights into how agents interact with
 your content.
 
- Future-proofing: Help establish a web where agent providers and websites can
 build mutual trust and make informed access decisions.

## Current status of Web Bot Auth: experimental

 Google's implementation of Web Bot Auth is currently experimental
 for the following reasons:

 
- Web Bot Auth is currently a draft specification developed by the IETF
 WBA Working Group,
 and it may change over time. Google continues to be engaged with the work of the Working Group
 as it evolves.
 
- User-agent and IP-based bot verification is currently the de facto standard, with decades of
 systems, policies, and best practices built around it. Changing these requires time and a
 careful approach, and we're at an early stage, still evaluating the technical characteristics
 and potential ecosystem implications of the protocol.

### What does this mean?

The experimental status means that:

 
- Not all Google user agents are using Web Bot Auth.
 
- Google is not yet signing every request of agents using the protocol.
 
- We recommend that in addition to Web Bot Auth you continue relying on IP addresses, reverse DNS, and user-agent strings
 as we gradually roll out signed traffic.

 For those that are interested in participating during the experimental phase, we're providing
 guidance on how to recognize and allowlist Google AI agents.

## How to allowlist Google AI agents using Web Bot Auth

 If you're a developer or system administrator looking to allowlist our experimental AI agents, you
 can implement verification through the Web Bot Auth protocol:

 
- Using a product or service that supports Web Bot Auth
 
- Verifying requests yourself

### Use a product or service that supports Web Both Auth

 Major bot-detection services, CDNs, and WAFs support Web Bot Auth. Some infrastructure services
 provide ways to look up the Google-Agent
 user agent and allowlist it; refer to your provider for the exact steps. A subset
 of requests made by the Google-Agent are signed with Web Bot Auth; in these
 cases, they are authenticated as https://agent.bot.goog. If your provider supports
 the protocol, they likely verify this automatically.

### Verify requests yourself

 If you want to authenticate our requests yourself, refer to the
 HTTP Message Signatures for automated traffic architecture specification
 and example implementations on GitHub.
 In general, the key protocol steps are:

 
- Fetch the public key set of our agent from https://agent.bot.goog/.well-known/http-message-signatures-directory
 and cache them according to the Cache-Control header.
 Be sure to delete old cached keys that are missing from the file, as they
 might be expired or revoked.
 
 
- Participating requests sent to your server will have the Signature-Agent HTTP
 request header set to g="https://agent.bot.goog" (take note of the g= label).
 
- Verify the Signature header according to the Signature-Input, following
 the HTTP Message Signatures standard (RFC 9421).
 Use the Signature and Signature-Input headers labeled as g.
 
- Don't forget to fall back to IP-based verification,
 as not all requests are signed.

 For latency-sensitive requests, you can return the response in advance and validate the signature
 within its expiry window.
 In this case, sanctioning will occur after the fact and you can apply that to the caller's future requests.

A signature's expiry window isn't the same as the public key set's Cache-Control
 header. Be sure to validate them separately.

## Next steps

 
- Contact your hosting or security provider to see if they support Web Bot Auth verification.
 
- Stay updated on the technical specifications of the Web Bot Auth Working Group.
 
- Participate in the discussion at the IETF mailing list.
 
- Send us feedback through our Web Bot Auth feedback form.
