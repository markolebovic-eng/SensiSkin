# How Google crawls locale-adaptive pages

 
If your site has locale-adaptive pages (that is, your site returns different content
 based on the perceived country or preferred language of the visitor), Google might not crawl,
 index, or rank all your content for different locales. This is because the default IP
 addresses of the Googlebot crawler appear to be based in the USA. In addition, the crawler
 sends HTTP requests without setting Accept-Language in the request header.

Important: We recommend using separate locale URL
 configurations and annotating them with rel="alternate"
 hreflang annotations.

## Geo-distributed crawling

Googlebot crawls with IP addresses based outside the USA, in addition to the US-based IP addresses.

As we have always recommended, when Googlebot appears to come from a certain country, treat
 it like you would treat any other user from that country. This means that if you block
 USA-based users from accessing your content, but allow visitors from Australia to see it,
 your server should block Googlebot if it appears to be coming from the USA, but allow access
 to Googlebot if it appears to come from Australia.

### Other considerations

 
- Googlebot uses the same user agent string for all crawling configurations. Learn more about
 the user agent strings used
 by Google crawlers.
 
- You can verify Googlebot
 geo-distributed crawls using reverse DNS lookups.
 
- If your site is using the robots exclusion protocol,
 make sure you apply it consistently
 across locales. This means that robots meta tags
 and the robots.txt file must
 specify the same rules in each locale.
