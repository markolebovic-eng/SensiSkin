# How to write and submit a robots.txt file

 

 
 If you use a site hosting service, such as Wix or Blogger, you might not need to (or
 be able to) edit your robots.txt file directly. Instead, your provider might expose a search
 settings page or some other mechanism to tell search engines whether or not to crawl your
 page.
 

 
 If you want to hide or unhide one of your pages from search engines, search for instructions
 about modifying your page visibility in search engines on your hosting service, for example,
 search for "wix hide page from search engines".
 

 You can
 control which files crawlers may access
 on your site with a robots.txt file.

 A robots.txt file lives at the root of your site. So, for site www.example.com,
 the robots.txt file lives at www.example.com/robots.txt. robots.txt is a plain
 text file that follows the
 Robots Exclusion Standard.
 A robots.txt file consists of one or more rules. Each rule blocks or allows access for all or
 a specific crawler to a specified file path on the domain or subdomain where the robots.txt
 file is hosted. Unless you specify otherwise in your robots.txt file, all files are implicitly
 allowed for crawling.

Here is a simple robots.txt file with two rules:

User-agent: Googlebot
Disallow: /nogooglebot/

User-agent: *
Allow: /

Sitemap: https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml

Here's what that robots.txt file means:

 
- 
 The user agent named Googlebot is not allowed to crawl any URL that starts with
 https://example.com/nogooglebot/.
 
 
- 
 All other user agents are allowed to crawl the entire site. This could have been omitted
 and the result would be the same; the default behavior is that user agents are allowed to
 crawl the entire site.
 
 
- 
 The site's sitemap file is located at
 https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml.
 

See the syntax section for more examples.

## Basic guidelines for creating a robots.txt file

 Creating a robots.txt file and making it generally accessible and useful involves four steps:

 
- Create a file named robots.txt.
 
- Add rules to the robots.txt file.
 
- Upload the robots.txt file to the root of your site.
 
- Test the robots.txt file.

## Create a robots.txt file

 You can use almost any text editor to create a robots.txt file. For example, Notepad,
 TextEdit, vi, and emacs can create valid robots.txt files. Don't use a word processor; word
 processors often save files in a proprietary format and can add unexpected characters, such as
 curly quotes, which can cause problems for crawlers. Make sure to save the file with UTF-8
 encoding if prompted during the save file dialog.

Format and location rules:

 
- The file must be named robots.txt.
 
- Your site can have only one robots.txt file.
 
- 
 The robots.txt file must be located at the root of the site host to
 which it applies. For instance, to control crawling on all URLs below
 https://www.example.com/, the robots.txt file must be located at
 https://www.example.com/robots.txt. It cannot be placed in a
 subdirectory (for example, at https://example.com/pages/robots.txt). If you're
 unsure about how to access your site root, or need permissions to do so, contact your web
 hosting service provider. If you can't access your site root, use an alternative blocking
 method such as meta tags.
 
 
- 
 A robots.txt file can be posted on a subdomain (for example,
 https://site.example.com/robots.txt) or on non-standard
 ports (for example, https://example.com:8181/robots.txt).
 
 
- A robots.txt file applies only to paths within the protocol, host, and port where it is
 posted. That is, rules in https://example.com/robots.txt apply only to files in
 https://example.com/, not to subdomains such as
 https://m.example.com/, or alternate protocols, such as
 http://example.com/.
 
 
- 
 A robots.txt file must be a UTF-8 encoded text file (which includes ASCII). Google may
 ignore characters that are not part of the UTF-8 range, potentially rendering robots.txt
 rules invalid.
 

## How to write robots.txt rules

 Rules are instructions for crawlers about which parts of your site they can crawl. Follow
 these guidelines when adding rules to your robots.txt file:

 
- A robots.txt file consists of one or more groups (set of rules).
 
- 
 Each group consists of multiple rules (also known as directives), one rule per line. Each
 group begins with a User-agent line that specifies the target of the groups.
 
 
- A group gives the following information:
 
 
- Who the group applies to (the user agent).
 
- Which directories or files that agent can access.
 
- Which directories or files that agent cannot access.
 

 
 
- 
 Crawlers process groups from top to bottom. A user agent can match only one rule set, which
 is the first, most specific group that matches a given user agent. If there are multiple
 groups for the same user agent, the groups will be combined into a single group before
 processing.
 
 
- 
 The default assumption is that a user agent can crawl any page or directory not blocked by a
 disallow rule.
 
 
- 
 Rules are case-sensitive. For instance, disallow: /file.asp applies to
 https://www.example.com/file.asp, but not
 https://www.example.com/FILE.asp.
 
 
- 
 The # character marks the beginning of a comment. Comments are ignored during
 processing.
 

Google's crawlers support the following rules in robots.txt files:

 
- 
 user-agent: [Required, one or more per group] The
 rule specifies the name of the automatic client known as search engine crawler that
 the rule applies to. This is the first line for any rule group. Google user agent names are
 listed in the
 Google list of user agents.
 Using an asterisk (*) matches all crawlers except the various AdsBot crawlers,
 which must be named explicitly. For example:

# Example 1: Block only Googlebot
User-agent: Googlebot
Disallow: /

# Example 2: Block Googlebot and Adsbot
User-agent: Googlebot
User-agent: AdsBot-Google
Disallow: /

# Example 3: Block all crawlers except AdsBot (AdsBot crawlers must be named explicitly)
User-agent: *
Disallow: /

 
 
- 
 disallow: [At least one or more disallow or
 allow entries per rule] A directory or page, relative to the root domain,
 that you don't want the user agent to crawl. If the rule refers to a page, it must be the
 full page name as shown in the browser. It must start with a / character and if
 it refers to a directory, it must end with the / mark.
 
 
- 
 allow: [At least one or more disallow or
 allow entries per rule] A directory or page, relative to the root domain,
 that may be crawled by the user agent just mentioned. This is used to override a
 disallow rule to allow crawling of a subdirectory or page in a disallowed
 directory. For a single page, specify the full page name as shown in the browser. It must
 start with a / character and if it refers to a directory, it must end with the
 / mark.
 
 
- 
 sitemap: [Optional, zero or more per file] The
 location of a sitemap for this site. The sitemap URL must be a fully-qualified URL;
 Google doesn't assume or check http/https/www.non-www alternates. Sitemaps are a good way to
 indicate which content Google should crawl, as opposed to which content it
 can or cannot crawl.
 Learn more about sitemaps.
 Example:

Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
Sitemap: https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml

 

 All rules, except sitemap, support the * wildcard for a path
 prefix, suffix, or entire string.

Lines that don't match any of these rules are ignored.

 Read our page about
 Google's interpretation of the robots.txt specification
 for the complete description of each rule.

## Upload the robots.txt file

 Once you saved your robots.txt file to your computer, you're ready to make it available to
 search engine crawlers. There's no one tool that can help you with this, because how you
 upload the robots.txt file to your site depends on your site and server architecture. Get in
 touch with your hosting company or search the documentation of your hosting company; for
 example, search for "upload files infomaniak".

 After you upload the robots.txt file, test whether it's publicly accessible and if Google can
 parse it.

## 
 Test robots.txt markup

 To test whether your newly uploaded robots.txt file is publicly accessible, open a
 private browsing window
 (or equivalent) in your browser and navigate to the location of the robots.txt file. For
 example, https://example.com/robots.txt. If you see the contents of your
 robots.txt file, you're ready to test the markup.

Google offers two options for fixing issues with robots.txt markup:

 
- 
 The 
 robots.txt report in Search Console. You can only use this report for robots.txt files
 that are already accessible on your site.
 
 
- 
 If you're a developer, check out and build
 Google's open source robots.txt library,
 which is also used in Google Search. You can use this tool to test robots.txt files locally
 on your computer.
 

## Submit robots.txt file to Google

 Once you uploaded and tested your robots.txt file, Google's crawlers will automatically find
 and start using your robots.txt file. You don't have to do anything. If you updated your
 robots.txt file and you need to refresh Google's cached copy as soon as possible, learn
 how to submit an updated robots.txt file.
