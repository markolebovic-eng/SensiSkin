## July 2026

 July 22
 
 

### Polished and clarified the crawl budget guide

 
 What: Polished and clarified the
 Optimize your crawl budget page to improve clarity,
 terminology consistency, and flow.
 

 
 Why: To make the documentation easier to understand and ensure technical terms
 (like crawl capacity limit) are used consistently throughout.
 

 
 July 16
 
 

### Updating the NotebookLM user agent

 
 What: Updated the NotebookLM user agent to be Google-GeminiNotebook.
 If you hardcoded the old value in your code, update the string to avoid potential bugs. We
 will continue to support the old value to allow for a smooth transition.
 

 
 Why: NotebookLM is now Gemini Notebook.
 

 
 July 14
 
 

### Corrected the user agent string for Google-InspectionTool user agent

 
 What: Updated the
 Google-InspectionTool
 user agent string.
 

 
 Why: The user agent string for Google-InspectionTool mistakenly included
 a semicolon, which didn't match the actual user agent string in production. This is now corrected in
 our documentation.
 

 

## May 2026

 May 4
 
 

### Adding Web Bot Auth documentation

 
 What: Added documentation on how to authenticate requests with Web Bot Auth.
 

 
 Why: To provide site owners with instructions on how to verify requests with Web Bot
 Auth during the experimental phase, as some Google user agents are now starting
 to use Web Bot Auth.
 

 

## March 2026

 March 20
 
 

### Added the Google-Agent user agent

 
 What: Added the Google-Agent user agent and added the IP ranges for user triggered
 agents to the documentation on verifying requests from Google crawlers and fetchers.
 

 
 Why: The Google-Agent user agent is rolling out over the next few weeks, and will be
 used by Google agents hosted on Google infrastructure to navigate the web and perform actions
 upon user request.
 

 
 March 3
 
 

### Added an overview page about Google's web crawling

 
 What: Added a new page about how Google's crawling works.
 

 
 Why: Based on questions we've received over the years, we've put together a resource
 page with basic educational information about crawling to better highlight various resources
 about crawling that are available to site owners.
 

 

## February 2026

 February 11
 
 

### Updated the location of Google's IP ranges for common crawlers, special crawlers, and user-triggered fetchers

 
 What: Updated the location of Google's
 IP ranges for common crawlers, special crawlers, and user-triggered fetchers
 to the /crawling/ipranges directory. The old location will continue to work for
 the time being, but we recommend updating your links to the new location.
 

 
 Why: Their previous location in /search/apis/ipranges was not the most
 logical place, as these IP ranges are used by many Google products (not just Search).
 

 
 February 3
 
 

### Added information about the default file size limits for Google's crawlers and fetchers

 
 What: Moved the information about the default file size limits of Google's crawlers and
 fetchers from the
 Googlebot documentation
 to the
 crawling documentation.
 

 
 Why: The original location of this information was not the most logical place as it
 applies to all of Google's crawlers and fetchers, and so we moved it to the crawler
 infrastructure documentation.
 

 

## January 2026

 January 21
 
 

### Added Google Messages to the list of user-triggered fetchers

 
 What: Added the Google Messages fetcher to the list of user-triggered fetchers.
 

 
 Why: To help site owners identify traffic from Google Messages when it generates link previews for URLs sent in chat messages.
 

 

## December 2025

 December 18
 
 

### Migrated more documentation to the Google crawling documentation site

 
 What: Migrated the following documentation to
 Google's crawling infrastructure site. The functionality hasn't changed,
 only the location of the documentation and some minor wording changes to clarify that some
 guidance applies to both Google Search and other Google products.
 

 
 
- Managing crawling of faceted navigation URLs
 
- Optimize your crawl budget
 
- How HTTP status codes affect Google's crawlers
 
- Debug DNS and network errors
 

 
 Why: This documentation is more relevant to many Google products that use Google's crawlers,
 not just Search.
 

 
 December 2
 
 

### Updated Google Read Aloud user agent page

 
 What: Updated the
 Google Read Aloud user agent page
 to provide additional details on how it functions, in particular that it uses stateless
 rendering, and that it needs to access the page to see the meta tags used on the page.
 

 
 Why: We received feedback through the help community that more information would be helpful.
 

 

## November 2025

 November 20
 

### Migrated documentation to the new Google crawling documentation site

 
 What: Migrated crawling documentation from the
 Google Search Central
 to a new Google crawling documentation site. The content hasn't changed,
 only the location. Notable moves include:
 

 
 
- Overview of Google crawlers and fetchers
 
- Verify requests from Google crawlers and fetchers
 
- Reduce the Google crawl rate
 
- Google common crawlers
 
- How Google interprets the robots.txt specification
 

 
 Why: Google's crawling infrastructure is shared across a variety of Google products beyond Search,
 including Google Shopping, News, Gemini, AdSense, and more. The new site
 is a more logical home for this documentation and makes it easier to document new features
 and updates that are relevant to all of these products.
 

 
 November 12
 
 

### Added the Google-Pinpoint fetcher

 
 What: We added the
 Google-Pinpoint
 fetcher to the list of user-triggered fetchers.
 

 
 Why: The Google-Pinpoint fetcher is used by the Pinpoint research tool.
 

 
 November 3
 
 

### Added a new user-triggered fetcher

 
 What: Based on feedback, we added the
 Google-CWS
 fetcher to the list of user-triggered fetchers.
 

 

## October 2025

 October 15
 
 

### Updated the list of Google products that use the Read Aloud service

 
 What: Update the documentation on Google Read Aloud with an updated list of Google products that use the Read Aloud service.
 

 
 Why: Other Google products can now use the Google Read Aloud service.
 

 
 October 9
 
 

### Added Google-NotebookLM to the list of user-triggered fetchers

 Google-NotebookLM
 to the list of user-triggered fetchers.

### Updated the Google Read Aloud user agent

 
 What: Updated Google Read Aloud user agent

## April 2025

 April 25
 
 

### Updated the description of the Google-Extended product token

 
 What: Based on publisher feedback, we updated the Google-Extended
 product token description to provide additional specificity and clarity.
 

 
 
 

### Corrected the description of the crawler preferences addressed to the Googlebot-News user agent

 
 What: Updated the
 Googlebot-News
 user agent description.
 

 
 Why: The description for how crawling preferences addressed to
 Googlebot-News mistakenly stated that they'd affect the News tab on Google,
 which is not the case.
