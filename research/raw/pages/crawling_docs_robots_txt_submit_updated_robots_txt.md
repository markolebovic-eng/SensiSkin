# Update your robots.txt file

 

 To update the rules in your existing robots.txt file, download a copy of your robots.txt file
 from your site and make the necessary edits. Then, upload the updated file to your site.

 
 If you use a site hosting service, such as Wix or Blogger, you might not need to (or
 be able to) edit your robots.txt file directly. Instead, your provider might expose a search
 settings page or some other mechanism to tell search engines whether or not to crawl your
 page.
 

 
 If you want to hide or unhide one of your pages from search engines, search for instructions
 about modifying your page visibility in search engines on your hosting service, for example,
 search for "wix hide page from search engines".
 

## Download your robots.txt file

 You can download your robots.txt file various ways, for example:

 
- 
 Navigate to your robots.txt file, for example https://example.com/robots.txt
 and copy its contents into a new text file on computer. Make sure you follow the guidelines
 related to the
 file format
 when creating the new local file.
 
 
- 
 Download an actual copy of your robots.txt file with a tool like curl. For example:

curl https://example.com/robots.txt -o robots.txt

 
 
- 
 Use the
 robots.txt report
 in Search Console to copy the content of your robots.txt file, which you can then paste into a
 file on your computer.
 

## Edit your robots.txt file

 Open the robots.txt file you downloaded from your site in a text editor and make the necessary
 edits to the rules. Make sure you use the
 correct syntax
 and that you save the file with UTF-8 encoding.

## Upload your robots.txt file

 Upload your new robots.txt file to the root directory of your site as a text file named
 robots.txt. The way you upload a file to your site is highly platform and server dependent. Check
 out our tips for finding help with
 uploading a robots.txt file to your site.

 
 If you do not have permission to upload files to the root directory of your site, contact
 your domain manager to make changes.
 

 
 For example, if your site home page resides under
 subdomain.example.com/site/example/, you likely cannot update the robots.txt file
 at subdomain.example.com/robots.txt. In this case, contact the owner of
 example.com/ to make any necessary changes to the robots.txt file.
 

## Refresh Google's robots.txt cache

 During the automatic crawling process, Google's crawlers notice changes you made to your
 robots.txt file and update the cached version every 24 hours. If you need to update the
 cache faster, use the Request a recrawl function of the
 robots.txt report.
