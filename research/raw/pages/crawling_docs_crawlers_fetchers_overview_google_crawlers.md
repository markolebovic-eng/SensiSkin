# Overview of Google crawlers and fetchers (user agents)

 

 Google uses crawlers and fetchers to perform actions for its products, either automatically or
 triggered by user request. Crawler (sometimes also called a "robot" or "spider") is a generic term
 for any program that is used to
 automatically discover and scan websites.
 Fetchers act as a program like
 wget that typically make a
 single request on behalf of a user. Google's clients fall into three categories:

 | Common crawlers
 | 
 The common crawlers used for Google's products (such as
 Googlebot). They
 always respect robots.txt rules for automatic crawls.
 
 

 
 | Special-case crawlers
 | 
 Special-case crawlers are similar to common crawlers, however are used by specific products
 where there's an agreement between the crawled site and the Google product about the crawl
 process. For example, AdsBot ignores the global robots.txt user agent
 (*) with the ad publisher's permission.
 
 

 
 | User-triggered fetchers
 | 
 User-triggered fetchers are part of tools and product functions where the end user triggers a
 fetch. For example,
 Google Site Verifier
 acts on the request of a user.
 
 

## Technical properties of Google's crawlers and fetchers

 Google's crawlers and fetchers are designed to be run simultaneously by thousands of machines to
 improve performance and scale as the web grows. To optimize bandwidth usage, these clients are
 distributed across many datacenters across the world so they're located near the sites that they
 might access. Therefore, your logs may show visits from several IP addresses.
 Google egresses primarily from IP addresses in the United States. In case Google detects that a
 site is blocking requests from the United States, it may attempt to crawl from IP addresses
 located in other countries.

### Supported transfer protocols

 Google's crawlers and fetchers support HTTP/1.1 and
 HTTP/2. The crawlers will
 use the protocol version that provides the best crawling performance and may switch protocols
 between crawling sessions depending on previous crawling statistics. The default protocol
 version used by Google's crawlers is HTTP/1.1; crawling over HTTP/2 may save computing resources
 (for example, CPU, RAM) for your site and Googlebot, but otherwise
 there's no Google-product specific benefit to the site (for example, no ranking boost in Google Search).
 To opt out from crawling over HTTP/2, instruct the server that's hosting your site to respond
 with a 421 HTTP status code when Google attempts to access your site over
 HTTP/2. If that's not feasible, you
 can send a message to the Crawling team
 (however this solution is temporary).

 Google's crawler infrastructure also supports crawling through FTP (as defined by
 RFC959 and its
 updates) and FTPS (as defined by
 RFC4217 and its
 updates), however crawling through these protocols is rare.

### Supported content encodings

 Google's crawlers and fetchers support the following content encodings (compressions):
 gzip,
 deflate, and
 Brotli (br). The
 content encodings supported by each Google user agent is advertised in the
 Accept-Encoding header of each request they make. For example,
 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br.

### File size limits

 By default, Google's crawlers and fetchers only crawl the first 15MB of a file, and any content
 beyond this limit is ignored. However, individual projects may set different limits for their crawlers and
 fetchers, and also for different file types. For example, a Google crawler
 like Googlebot may
 have a smaller size limit (for example, 2MB), or specify a larger file size limit for a PDF than for HTML.

### Crawl rate and host load

 Our goal
 is to crawl as many pages from your site as we can on each visit without overwhelming your
 server. If your site is having trouble keeping up with Google's crawling requests, you can
 reduce the crawl rate. Note that
 sending the inappropriate
 HTTP response code
 to Google's crawlers may affect how your site appears in Google products.

### HTTP Caching

 Google's crawling infrastructure supports heuristic HTTP caching as defined by the
 HTTP caching standard,
 specifically through the ETag response- and If-None-Match request
 header, and the Last-Modified response- and If-Modified-Since request
 header.

 Note: Consider setting both the Etag and Last-Modified values regardless
 of the preference of Google's crawlers. These headers are also used by other applications such
 as CMSes.

 If both ETag and Last-Modified response header fields are present in the
 HTTP response, Google's crawlers use the ETag value as
 required by the HTTP standard.
 For Google's crawlers specifically, we recommend using
 ETag
 instead of the Last-Modified header to indicate caching preference as
 ETag doesn't have date formatting issues.

 Other HTTP caching directives aren't supported.

 Individual Google crawlers and fetchers may or may not make use of caching, depending on the needs
 of the product they're associated with. For example, Googlebot supports caching when
 re-crawling URLs for Google Search, and Storebot-Google only supports caching in
 certain conditions.

 To implement HTTP caching for your site, get in touch with your hosting or content management
 system provider.

#### ETag and If-None-Match

 Google's crawling infrastructure supports ETag and If-None-Match as
 defined by the
 HTTP Caching standard.
 Learn more about the
 ETag
 response header and its request header counterpart,
 If-None-Match.

#### Last-Modified and If-Modified-Since

 Google's crawling infrastructure supports Last-Modified and
 If-Modified-Since as defined by the
 HTTP Caching standard
 with the following caveats:

 
- 
 The date in the Last-Modified header must be formatted according to the
 HTTP standard.
 To avoid parsing issues, we recommend using the following date format:
 "Weekday, DD Mon YYYY HH:MM:SS Timezone". For example,
 "Fri, 4 Sep 1998 19:15:56 GMT".
 
 
- 
 While not required, consider also setting the
 max-age field of the Cache-Control response header
 to help crawlers determine when to recrawl the specific URL. Set the value of the
 max-age field to the expected number of seconds the content will be unchanged. For
 example, Cache-Control: max-age=94043.
 

 Learn more about the
 Last-Modified
 response header and its request header counterpart, If-Modified-Since.

## Verify Google's crawlers and fetchers

 Google's crawlers identify themselves in three ways:

 
- 
 The HTTP user-agent request header.
 
 
- 
 The source IP address of the request.
 
 
- 
 The reverse DNS hostname of the source IP.
 

 Learn how to use these details to
 verify Google's crawlers and fetchers.
