# Myths and facts about crawling

 

 Test your knowledge on how Google crawls websites.

 Compressing my sitemaps can increase my crawl budget.

 
 True

 
 

 

 
 False

 It won't. Zipped sitemaps still have to be fetched from the server, so you're not really
 saving much crawling time or effort on Google's part by sending compressed sitemaps.

 

 Google prefers fresher content, so I'd better keep tweaking my page.

 
 True

 
 

 

 
 False

 For Google Search, content is rated by quality, regardless of age. Create and update your content as
 necessary, but there's no additional value in making pages artificially appear to be
 fresh by making trivial changes and updating the page date.

 

 Google prefers old content (it has more weight) over fresh content.

 
 True

 
 

 

 
 False

 If your page is useful, it's useful, whether it's new or old.

 

 Google prefers clean URLs and doesn't like query parameters.

 
 True

 
 

 

 
 False

 We can crawl parameters.

 

 The faster your pages load and render, the more Google is able to crawl.

 
 
 True
 

 
 True, in that our resources are limited by a combination of time and number of crawling
 bots. If you can serve us more pages in a limited time, we will be able to crawl more
 of them. However, we might devote more time crawling a site that has more important
 information, even if it is slower. It's probably more important for you to make your
 site faster for your users than to make it faster to increase your crawl coverage. It's
 much simpler to help Google crawl the right content than it is to crawl all your content
 every time. Note that crawling a site involves both retrieving and rendering the
 content. Time spent rendering the page counts as much as time spent requesting the page.
 So making your pages faster to render will also increase the crawl speed.
 

 

 
 False

 
 

 

 Small sites aren't crawled as often as big ones.

 
 
 True
 

 
 

 

 
 False

 
 If a site has important content that changes often, we crawl it often, regardless of the size.
 

 

 The closer your content is to the home page the more important it is to Google.

 
 True

 
 

 

 
 
 Partly true
 

 
 Your site's home page is often the most important page on
 your site, and so pages linked directly to the home page may be seen as more important,
 and therefore crawled more often. However, this doesn't mean that these pages will be
 ranked more highly than other pages on your site.
 

 

 
 False

 
 

 

 URL versioning is a good way to encourage Google to recrawl my pages.

 
 True

 
 

 

 
 
 Partly true
 

 
 Using a versioned URL for your page in order to entice
 Google to crawl it again sooner will probably work, but often this is not necessary,
 and will waste crawl resources if the page is not actually changed. If you do use
 versioned URLs to indicate new content, we recommend that you only
 change the URL when the page content has changed meaningfully.
 

 

 
 False

 
 

 

 Site speed and errors affect my crawl budget.

 
 
 True
 

 
 Making a site faster improves the users' experience while also increasing crawl rate. For
 Google's crawlers, a speedy site is a sign of healthy servers, so it can get more content over
 the same number of connections. On the flip side, a significant number of
 5xx HTTP response status codes
 (server errors) or connection timeouts signal the opposite, and
 crawling slows down. We recommend paying attention to the Crawl Stats report in Search
 Console and keeping the number of server errors low.
 

 

 
 False

 
 

 

 Crawling is a ranking factor in Google Search.

 
 
 True
 

 
 

 

 
 False

 
 Improving your crawl rate won't necessarily lead to better positions in Google Search results.
 Google uses many signals to rank the results, and while crawling is necessary for a
 page to be in search results, it's not a ranking signal.
 

 

 Alternate URLs and embedded content count in the crawl budget.

 
 
 True
 

 
 Generally, any URL that Googlebot crawls will count towards a site's crawl budget.
 Alternate URLs, like AMP or hreflang, as well as embedded content, such as CSS and
 JavaScript, including XHR fetches,
 may have to be crawled and will consume a site's crawl budget.
 

 

 
 False

 
 

 

 I can control Google's crawlers with the "crawl-delay" rule.

 
 
 True
 

 
 

 

 
 False

 
 The non-standard "crawl-delay" robots.txt rule is not processed by Google's crawlers.
 

 

 The nofollow rule affects crawl budget.

 
 True

 
 

 

 
 
 Partly true
 

 
 Any URL that is crawled affects crawl budget, so even if
 your page marks a URL as nofollow, it can still be crawled if another page
 on your site, or any page on the web, doesn't label the link as nofollow.
 

 

 
 False

 
 

 

 I can use noindex to control crawl budget.

 
 True

 
 

 

 
 
 Partly true
 

 
 Any URL that is crawled affects crawl budget, and Google has to crawl the page in order
 to find the noindex rule.
 
 
 However, noindex is there to help you keep things out of the index. If you
 want to ensure that those pages don't end up in Google's index, continue using noindex
 and don't worry about crawl budget. It's also important to note that if you remove URLs
 from Google's index with noindex or otherwise, Google's crawlers can focus on
 other URLs on your site, which means noindex can indirectly free up some crawl
 budget for your site in the long run.
 

 

 
 False

 
 

 

 Pages that serve 4xx HTTP status codes are wasting crawl budget.

 
 True

 
 

 

 
 False

 
 Pages that serve 4xx HTTP status codes
 (except 429) don't waste crawl budget. Google attempted to
 crawl the page, but received a status code and no other content.
