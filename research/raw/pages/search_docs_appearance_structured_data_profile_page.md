# Profile page (ProfilePage) structured data

 

ProfilePage markup is designed for any site where creators (either people or
 organizations) share first-hand perspectives. Adding this markup helps Google Search understand
 the creators that post in an online community, and show better content from that community in
 search results, including the Discussions and Forums feature.

Other structured data features can link to pages with ProfilePage markup too. For example,
 Article
 and Recipe structured data have authors,
 and there are often several authors present in discussion forum
 and Q&A page structured data.

 

## 
 How to add structured data
 

 Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page
 content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about
 how structured data works.
 

 
 Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data.

 
 
- Add the required properties. Based on the
 format you're using, learn where to insert structured data on the page.
 
 Using a CMS? It may be easier to use a plugin that's integrated into your CMS.
 
 Using JavaScript? Learn how to
 generate structured data with JavaScript.
 
 
- Follow the guidelines.
 
- Validate your code using the
 Rich Results Test
 and fix any critical errors. Consider also fixing any non-critical issues that may be flagged
 in the tool, as they can help improve the quality of your structured data (however, this isn't necessary to be eligible for rich results). 
 
- Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is
 accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or
 login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can
 ask Google to recrawl your URLs.
 Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it
 may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
 
 
- To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you
 submit a sitemap. You can automate this with the
 Search Console Sitemap API.
 

 

## Examples
