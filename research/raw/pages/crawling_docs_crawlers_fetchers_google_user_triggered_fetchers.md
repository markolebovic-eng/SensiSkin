# List of Google user-triggered fetchers

 

 User-triggered fetchers are initiated by users to perform a fetching function within a Google
 product. For example,
 Google Site Verifier
 acts on a user's request, or a site hosted on Google Cloud (GCP) has a feature that allows the
 site's users to retrieve an external RSS feed. Because the fetch was requested by a user, these
 fetchers generally ignore robots.txt rules. The general
 technical properties
 of Google's crawlers also apply to the user-triggered fetchers.

 The IP ranges the user-triggered fetchers use are
 published in the
 user-triggered-fetchers.json,
 user-triggered-fetchers-google.json,
 and user-triggered-agents.json
 objects. The user-triggered fetchers' reverse DNS mask, depending on whether the fetcher is Google
 or user owned, matches ***-***-***-***.gae.googleusercontent.com or
 google-proxy-***-***-***-***.google.com respectively.

 The following list shows the user-triggered fetchers, their user agent strings as they appear in
 the HTTP requests, and the products they are associated with. The list is not exhaustive, it only
 covers the requestors that are more likely to show up in log files and that we've received
 questions about.

 Caution: The user agent string can be spoofed.
 Learn how to verify if a request is from Google.
