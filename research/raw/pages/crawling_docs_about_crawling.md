# Things to know about Google's web crawling

 

 Google has been crawling the open web
 for over 30 years now,
 and we regularly get asked questions about how our web crawlers work. To answer some of them, here
 are a few facts about Google's crawlers and how they help us organize the world's information,
 connecting people to content from across the web.

## What is crawling? In short, crawling is how Google "sees" the web

 Crawling is the process of using automated software to discover new web pages and to understand
 them. That way, when you come to Google to find a web page, we know that it exists and we can
 include it in your search results. All search engines rely on crawling to know what pages and
 information may be out there. You can watch our video on how Google Search crawls pages
 to learn more.

## We have many crawlers; they each have important jobs

 Googlebot is our most well-known crawler, and it's used to keep results in Google Search fresh
 and up-to-date. We also have crawlers that are specific to our other surfaces, such as Google
 Images and Google Shopping. We provide full documentation
 of our most commonly used crawlers and what they're for. Our crawlers use easily identifiable
 user-agent names and known internet addresses. This way, site owners can be confident that the
 Google crawlers they're seeing are legitimate.

## We perform repeat crawls to find the latest updates and to provide the freshest search results

 To catch breaking news articles, we may recrawl news homepages every few minutes. In other cases
 we might have seen that nothing has changed for years, so we might wait a month to recrawl. Site
 owners can influence how often recrawling happens using sitemap
 files that tell us about new and updated pages.

## Frequent crawling is a good sign!

If we're crawling your site a lot, it's an indication your pages have fresh or highly relevant
 content that people want to find, and that our systems are recognizing that demand. Online
 shopping is a great example: we crawl ecommerce sites often so that our results will display
 retailers' most up-to-date prices, promotions, and inventory status.

## Google's crawling has grown over time as pages have become more complex

 Another reason we recrawl frequently is to fully understand the richness of a web page and what
 it offers. Our crawlers use a technique called rendering, which loads a site in full to "see" a
 page just as a real person would. Over the years, web pages have gotten more sophisticated; the
 median mobile page
 has grown in size from 816 kilobytes to 2.3 megabytes,
 and now has more than 60 different files
 to load, from images to interactive components. So to get a representative snapshot of a web page
 in all its glory, we might need to crawl the same page several times — or more, as new
 elements get added all the time.

## We optimize crawling automatically

 Our crawlers are engineered for efficiency, and they adjust themselves to minimize the impact on
 site owners. For example, when a site slows down or returns errors, our
 crawl rate changes automatically
 to avoid overloading the site's servers. We try to limit wasteful crawling by caching the crawled
 content. And as our crawlers discover more of a website, they're also able to recognize sections
 that can be covered with less crawling; for example, calendars that go to the year 9999 probably
 don't need to be crawled in their entirety. Site owners can help by identifying
 what content doesn't need to be crawled, which saves websites money by lowering their
 infrastructure costs and makes the internet more efficient as a whole.

## Google crawlers never go into paywall or subscription content without permission

 By default, if a page isn't accessible on the open web — for example, if the content is
 behind a login page — our crawlers can't access it, either. We have specific
 guidance for site owners if they want to
 give Google explicit permission to access subscription pages (for example, so that Google can refer
 users to that content). If you choose to provide subscription access to our crawlers, you can
 use structured data
 to continue showing human visitors a login screen without triggering our
 rules on spam. And you can keep subscription
 content from appearing in page previews by taking advantage of
 preview controls.

## Site owners have control over what gets crawled, and how

We honor open web standards such as robots.txt,
 a simple text file that lets site owners declare how crawlers like ours should interact with their
 pages. Robots.txt, along with robots meta tags,
 empowers websites to easily communicate to Google and other services how to access their content.
 They can block pages from appearing in Search. They can tell us about new content they want
 crawled using sitemaps. And
 they can manage how frequently we crawl their sites via their
 crawl budget.

## Our standard crawlers
 always respect websites' choices about how their content is accessed and used

After a crawl, we may use the crawled data multiple times to reduce the need for wasteful repeat
 requests on sites. Even when we reuse this data, we continue to respect the choices sites make
 through robots.txt and the controls we offer through that open web protocol. For example, sites
 can use Google-Extended
 in robots.txt to control, among other things, whether their content helps train future versions of
 Gemini models. Utilizing Google-Extended doesn't affect a site's inclusion in Search, nor do we
 use Google-Extended as a ranking signal in Search.

 We provide many tools for site owners to manage their Google crawling experience, including
 Google Search Console,
 which is available at no cost to site owners. It provides information on
 how much we've crawled, and why.
 It also helps sites diagnose problems such as server downtime or speed issues. In addition, Search
 Console provides comprehensive information on how a site's pages are visible in Search and how
 users are engaging with them.

 Our crawlers help connect people to the best of the web, and we're always looking for ways to make
 them more capable and efficient.
