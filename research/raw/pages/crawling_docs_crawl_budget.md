# Optimize your crawl budget

 

 This guide describes how to optimize Google's crawling of very large and frequently updated sites.

 If your site doesn't have a large number of pages that change rapidly, or if your pages seem
 to be crawled the same day that they are published, you don't need to read this guide. For Google
 Search specifically,
 keeping your sitemap up to date and
 checking the Page Indexing report
 regularly is adequate.

## Who this guide is for

 While the recommendations in this guide are generally good practices, this is an advanced guide
 intended primarily for the following types of sites:

 
- 
 Large sites (1 million+ unique pages) with content that changes moderately often (once a week)
 
 
- 
 Medium or larger sites (10,000+ unique pages) with very rapidly changing content (daily)
 
 
- 
 Sites with a large portion of their total URLs classified by Search Console as
 Discovered - currently not indexed
 

 The numbers given here are a rough estimate to help you classify your site. These are not
 exact thresholds.

## General theory of crawling

 
 

 The web is a nearly infinite space, exceeding Google's ability to explore every publicly
 accessible URL. As a result, there are limits to how much time and resources Google can devote to
 crawling any single site. The allocation of these resources is commonly called a site's
 crawl budget. In this context, Google's crawling infrastructure defines a site as a
 unique hostname. For example, https://www.example.com/ and
 https://code.example.com/ are treated as separate sites and have separate crawl
 budgets. A site's crawl budget is determined by two main elements: crawl capacity limit and
 crawl demand.

 For Google Search, not every page that is crawled will necessarily be indexed. After crawling,
 each page must be evaluated,
 consolidated,
 and assessed to determine its suitability for the index.

### Crawl capacity limit

 Google wants to crawl your site without overwhelming your servers. To prevent this, Google's
 crawlers calculate a crawl capacity limit (also known as
 hostload).
 This limits the total amount of time your server spends holding connections open for Google,
 factoring in both the number of parallel connections and their duration. This ensures Google
 can cover all your important content without overloading your servers.

 Every site starts with the same default, conservative crawl capacity limit. If there is demand to
 crawl more and the site remains healthy, Google's systems will automatically adjust this limit
 over time.

The crawl capacity limit can go up and down based on a few factors:

 
- Crawl health: If the site responds consistently and its response times (including
 latency and Time-to-First Byte) remain stable or improve, the limit goes up, meaning more
 connections can be used to crawl. If the site slows down (latency increases or response times
 become longer), or responds with server errors (5xx HTTP status codes) or
 rate-limiting signals (such as HTTP 429), the limit goes down and Google crawls
 less.
 
 
- 
 Google's crawling limits: While Google's resources are extensive, they are finite, and
 we must prioritize resource allocation across the web.
 

### Crawl demand

 Each crawler has its own "demand" when it comes to crawling the web, determined by factors
 unique to that crawler. For example, AdsBot generally has a higher demand when a site is running
 dynamic ad targets, and Google Shopping has a higher demand for products you have in your merchant
 feeds.

 For Googlebot, demand varies based on
 a site's size, update frequency, page quality, and relevance, compared to other sites. The
 primary factors you can influence are:

 
- 
 Perceived inventory: Without guidance from you, Google tries to crawl all or most of the
 URLs that it knows about on your site. If many of these URLs are duplicates, or you don't want
 them crawled for some other reason (removed, unimportant, and so on), this wastes a lot of
 Google crawling time on your site. This is the factor that you can positively control the most.
 
 
- 
 Popularity: URLs that are more popular on the Internet tend to be crawled more often to
 keep them fresher in our systems.
 
 
- 
 Staleness: Our systems want to recrawl documents frequently enough to pick up any
 changes.
 

 Additionally, site-wide events like site moves may trigger an increase in crawl demand in order
 to reprocess the content under the new URLs.

 While each crawler has a different crawl demand, the crawl capacity limit is shared
 across all crawlers. This means that high demand from one crawler can reduce the capacity
 available for others.

### Summary

 Taking crawl capacity and crawl demand together, Google defines a site's crawl budget as the set
 of URLs that Google can and wants to crawl. Even if the crawl capacity limit isn't reached, if
 crawl demand is low, Google will crawl your site less.

## Best practices

To maximize your crawling efficiency, follow these best practices:

 
- 
 Manage your URL inventory: Use the appropriate tools to tell Google which pages to crawl
 and which not to crawl. If Google spends too much time crawling URLs that it shouldn't, Google's
 crawlers might not explore the rest of your site, or might not increase your crawl budget.
 
 
- 
 Consolidate duplicate content.
 Eliminate duplicate content to focus crawling on unique content rather than unique URLs.
 
 
- 
 Block crawling of URLs using robots.txt.
 Some pages might be important to users, but you don't necessarily want them to appear on
 Google surfaces or get reprocessed by Google's systems. Examples include infinite scrolling
 pages that duplicate information on linked pages, or differently sorted versions of the same
 page. If you can't consolidate them as described in the first bullet, block these
 unimportant pages using
 robots.txt. Blocking URLs with
 robots.txt prevents Google from crawling them, and significantly decreases the chance the
 URLs will be processed by other Google systems (such as getting indexed by Google Search).
 
 Don't use noindex, as Google will still request, but then drop the
 page when it sees a noindex meta tag or header in the HTTP
 response, wasting crawling time.
 Don't use robots.txt to temporarily reallocate crawl budget for other pages; use
 robots.txt to block pages or resources that you don't want Google to crawl at all. Google
 won't shift this newly available crawl budget to other pages unless Google is already
 hitting your site's crawl capacity limit.
 
 
 
- 
 Return a 404 or 410 status code for permanently removed pages.
 Google won't forget a URL that it knows about, but a 404 status code is a
 strong signal not to crawl that URL again. Blocked URLs, however, will stay part of your
 crawl queue much longer, and will be recrawled when the block is removed.
 
 
- 
 Eliminate soft 404 errors.
 soft 404 pages will continue to be crawled, and waste your budget. Check the
 Page Indexing report
 for soft 404 errors.
 
 
- 
 Keep your sitemaps up to date. Google reads your sitemap regularly, so be sure to
 include all the content that you want Google to crawl. If your site includes updated
 content, we recommend including the <lastmod> tag.
 
 
- 
 Avoid long redirect chains, which have a negative effect on crawling.
 
 

 
 
- 
 Make your pages efficient to load.
 If Google can load and render your pages faster, we might be able to read more content from your
 site.
 
 
- 
 Improve loading speed: Optimize your server response times and resources to make pages
 load faster.
 
 
- 
 Use HTTP caching: Support
 304 (Not Modified) HTTP status codes.
 If a page hasn't changed since Google last crawled it, returning a 304 code tells
 Google to reuse the cached version, saving your server bandwidth and resources.
 
 

 
 
- 
 Debug issues with crawl budget.
 Check whether your site had any availability issues during crawling, and look for ways to make
 your crawling more efficient.
 

## How do I get more crawl budget?

There are two ways to increase crawl budget:

 
- 
 Add more server resources: If your site can't be crawled because of server capacity on
 your end (for example, you're getting
 Hostload exceeded
 in the URL inspection tool), add more server resources if that makes sense for your business.
 
 
- 
 Optimize your content's quality for the Google product you're targeting: Google
 determines the crawling resources allocated to each site by factoring in elements that are
 relevant to the specific Google product. For example, for Google Search, this includes things
 like popularity, overall user value, content uniqueness, and serving capacity.
