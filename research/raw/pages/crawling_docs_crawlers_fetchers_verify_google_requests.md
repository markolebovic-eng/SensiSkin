# Verify requests from Google crawlers and fetchers

 

 You can verify if a request to your server really is
 from Google. Verification
 is possible for crawlers such as Googlebot, as well as other requests. This is useful if you're
 concerned that spammers or other troublemakers are accessing your site while claiming to be from
 Google.

Google's crawlers and fetchers fall into three categories:

 
 Type
 Description
 Reverse DNS mask
 IP ranges
 

 
 | Common crawlers
 | 
 The common crawlers used for Google's products (such as Googlebot). They always respect
 robots.txt rules for automatic crawls.
 
 | 
 crawl-***-***-***-***.googlebot.com or
 geo-crawl-***-***-***-***.geo.googlebot.com
 
 | common-crawlers.json
 

 
 | Special-case crawlers
 | 
 Crawlers or fetchers that perform specific functions for Google products (such as AdsBot) where there's an
 agreement between the crawled site and the product about the access or for
 abuse-specific crawling or fetching. These crawlers or fetchers may
 or may not respect robots.txt rules.
 
 | rate-limited-proxy-***-***-***-***.google.com
 | special-crawlers.json
 

 
 | User-triggered fetchers
 | 
 Tools and product functions where the end user triggers a fetch. For example,
 Google Site Verifier
 acts on the request of a user. Because the fetch was requested by a user, these fetchers
 ignore robots.txt rules.
 Fetchers controlled by Google originate from IPs in the
 user-triggered-fetchers-google.json object and resolve to a
 google.com hostname. IPs in the user-triggered-fetchers.json object
 resolve to gae.googleusercontent.com hostnames. These IPs are used, for example,
 if a site running on Google Cloud (GCP) has a feature that requires fetching external RSS
 feeds on the request of the user of that site.
 
 | 
 ***-***-***-***.gae.googleusercontent.com or
 google-proxy-***-***-***-***.google.com
 
 | 
 user-triggered-fetchers.json,
 user-triggered-fetchers-google.json,
 and user-triggered-agents.json
 
 

There are two methods for verifying requests from Google:

 
- 
 Manually: For one-off lookups, use command line tools. This method is
 sufficient for most use cases.
 
 
- 
 Automatically: For large scale lookups, use an automatic solution to
 match a crawler's IP address against the list of published Google IP addresses.
 

## Use command line tools

 
- 
 Run a reverse DNS lookup on the accessing IP address from your logs, using the
 host command.
 
 
- 
 Verify that the domain name is either googlebot.com, google.com, or
 googleusercontent.com.
 
 
- 
 Run a forward DNS lookup on the domain name retrieved in step 1 using the host
 command on the retrieved domain name.
 
 
- Verify that it's the same as the original accessing IP address from your logs.

Example 1:

host 66.249.66.1
1.66.249.66.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer crawl-66-249-66-1.googlebot.com.

host crawl-66-249-66-1.googlebot.com
crawl-66-249-66-1.googlebot.com has address 66.249.66.1

Example 2:

host 35.247.243.240
240.243.247.35.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer geo-crawl-35-247-243-240.geo.googlebot.com.

host geo-crawl-35-247-243-240.geo.googlebot.com
geo-crawl-35-247-243-240.geo.googlebot.com has address 35.247.243.240

Example 3:

host 66.249.90.77
77.90.249.66.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer rate-limited-proxy-66-249-90-77.google.com.

host rate-limited-proxy-66-249-90-77.google.com
rate-limited-proxy-66-249-90-77.google.com has address 66.249.90.77

## Use automatic solutions

 Alternatively, you can identify Googlebot by IP address by matching the crawler's IP address
 to the lists of Google crawlers' and fetchers' IP ranges:

 
- Common crawlers like Googlebot
 
- Special crawlers like AdsBot
 
- User-triggered fetchers (users)
 
- User-triggered fetchers (Google)
 
- User-triggered agents

 For other Google IP addresses from where your site may be accessed (for example,
 Apps Scripts), match the accessing IP address
 against the general
 list of Google IP addresses.
 Note that the IP addresses in the JSON files are represented in
 CIDR format.
