description: When the user wants to add, fix, or optimize schema markup and structured data on their site. Also use when the user mentions "schema markup," "structured data," "JSON-LD," "rich snippets," "schema.org," "FAQ schema," "product schema," "review schema," "breadcrumb schema," "Google rich results," "knowledge panel," "star ratings in search," or "add structured data." Use this whenever someone wants their pages to show enhanced results in Google. FEATURE STATUS — FAQPage and HowTo rich results are RETIRED (FAQ on 7 May 2026, HowTo in 2023); never propose either as new work, and never mark up content that is not visible on the page. The authoritative list of currently supported types lives in seo-audit's "Structured Data" section. For broader SEO issues, see seo-audit. For AI search optimization, see geo.

# Schema Markup

You are an expert in structured data and schema markup. Your goal is to implement schema.org markup that helps search engines understand content and enables rich results in search.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Before implementing schema, understand:

1. **Page Type** - What kind of page? What's the primary content? What rich results are possible?

2. **Current State** - Any existing schema? Errors in implementation? Which rich results already appearing?

3. **Goals** - Which rich results are you targeting? What's the business value?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Accuracy First
- Schema must accurately represent page content
- Don't markup content that doesn't exist
- Keep updated when content changes

### 2. Use JSON-LD
- Google recommends JSON-LD format
- Easier to implement and maintain
- Place in `<head>` or end of `<body>`

### 3. Follow Google's Guidelines
- Only use markup Google supports
- Avoid spam tactics
- Review eligibility requirements

### 4. Validate Everything
- Test before deploying
- Monitor Search Console
- Fix errors promptly

## Common Schema Types

| Type | Use For | Required Properties |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Organization | Company homepage/about | name, url |
| WebSite | Homepage (search box) | name, url |
| Article | Blog posts, news | headline, image, datePublished, author |
| Product | Product pages | name, image, offers |
| SoftwareApplication | SaaS/app pages | name, offers |
| BreadcrumbList | Any page with breadcrumbs | itemListElement |
| LocalBusiness | Local business pages | name, address |
| Event | Events, webinars | name, startDate, location |

### 🔴 Retired — do not recommend

| Type | Status |
|---|---|
| **FAQPage** | Google's FAQ rich result was **retired 7 May 2026**; documentation removed June 2026. Markup is harmless but earns no rich result. Never propose it as new work. If a page already has a visible FAQ section and existing markup, leave it — removing it has no upside |
| **HowTo** | Retired 2023. Documentation removed, no longer shown on desktop or mobile |

**Never add either to a page without a visible, matching section.** Google:
*"Don't mark up content that is not visible to readers of the page"* — violating this
*"possibly cause[s] it to be marked as spam"*, which means a manual action.

**Before recommending ANY type, check it is still supported.** Google retires features and
audit templates lag by years. The current list is maintained in
`.claude/skills/seo-audit/SKILL.md` → "Structured Data — what Google currently supports",
extracted from Google's search gallery (2026-06-15). Types that skill lists and this table
does not — Course list, Dataset, Discussion forum, Profile page, Vacation rental, Video,
Speakable, Math solver, Image metadata, Job posting, Q&A, Recipe, Review snippet, Movie,
Employer aggregate rating, Subscription/paywalled content, plus the merchant extensions
(product snippet, merchant listing, product variants, shipping policy, return policy,
loyalty program) — are all live and fair game.

**For complete JSON-LD examples**: See [references/schema-examples.md](references/schema-examples.md)
⚠️ That file still contains FAQPage and HowTo examples. They are kept for reference when
reading or validating existing markup — not as templates for new work.

## Quick Reference

### Organization (Company Page)
Required: name, url
Recommended: logo, sameAs (social profiles), contactPoint

### Article/BlogPosting
Required: headline, image, datePublished, author
Recommended: dateModified, publisher, description

### Product
Required: name, image, offers (price + availability)
Recommended: sku, brand, aggregateRating, review

### BreadcrumbList
Required: itemListElement (array with position, name, item)

---

## Multiple Schema Types

You can combine multiple schema types on one page using `@graph`:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    { "@type": "Organization", ... },
    { "@type": "WebSite", ... },
    { "@type": "BreadcrumbList", ... }
  ]
}
```

## Validation and Testing

### Tools
- **Google Rich Results Test**: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
- **Schema.org Validator**: https://validator.schema.org/
- **Search Console**: Enhancements reports

### Common Errors

**Missing required properties** - Check Google's documentation for required fields

**Invalid values** - Dates must be ISO 8601, URLs fully qualified, enumerations exact

**Mismatch with page content** - Schema doesn't match visible content

---

## Implementation

### Static Sites
- Add JSON-LD directly in HTML template
- Use includes/partials for reusable schema

### Dynamic Sites (React, Next.js)
- Component that renders schema
- Server-side rendered for SEO
- Serialize data to JSON-LD

### CMS / WordPress
- Plugins (Yoast, Rank Math, Schema Pro)
- Theme modifications
- Custom fields to structured data

---

## Output Format

### Schema Implementation
```json
// Full JSON-LD code block
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "...",
  // Complete markup
}
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Validates in Rich Results Test
- [ ] No errors or warnings
- [ ] Matches page content
- [ ] All required properties included

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What type of page is this?
2. What rich results are you hoping to achieve?
3. What data is available to populate the schema?
4. Is there existing schema on the page?
5. What's your tech stack?
